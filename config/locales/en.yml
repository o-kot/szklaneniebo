    text: "I've always been fascinated by stained glass.\nAn image that changes. Light dancing to a sunny music.\nI used to be convinced that stained glass was a hobby only for a few chosen.\nAnd so it is - it requires patience, humility, acceptance and unhurriedness.\nGlass - brittle and hard, cold and warm, delicate and sharp...\nIt's been fascinating me and filling my free time.\nMy stained glass hobby has been going on for several years, I use the Tiffany technique.\nMy works can be found in many homes, both in Poland and abroad.\nCONTACT - alicja-631@wp.pl\nThank you for visiting my website..."
